Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University, where I have achieved a GPA of 3.75/4.0, with a Major GPA of 4.0/4.0. My coursework has provided me with a solid foundation in computer science, ranking 24st out of 173 students in my program. Through my studies, I have developed proficiency in C, C++, Python, and Matlab, and my experiences in class and self-directed projects have enabled me to tackle complex computational challenges with confidence. My academic work has also shown me the importance of maintaining rigor in both my theoretical understanding and practical application of knowledge, reinforcing my ability in this field.
